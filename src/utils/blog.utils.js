      '<p>Google Ad Manager(GAM) is one of the most robust app monetizations. Even then, publishers have a lot of confusion surrounding the accessibility of GAM! Moreover, the most often asked by publishers is what is Google Ad Manager?</p><p>In this article, we have offered publishers a detailed view of Google Ad Manager that covers the basic understanding that you must have about GAM.</p><p><br></p><h2>Let Us Start with What Is Google Ad Manager?</h2><p><br></p><p>Google Ad Manager is an ad server or an ad management platform for an app or web publisher. It enables publishers to run, analyze and bill their ad campaigns, direct or indirect, through a single platform.</p><p>Google Ad Manager supports multiple ad exchanges and networks within its ecosystem, including Google Ad Exchange(Google AdX) and other third-party ad networks.</p><p><br></p><h2>How Does Google Ad Manager Work?</h2><p><br></p><p><a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/blog/quick-guide-on-google-adx/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Ad Manager</a> is a platform that facilitates buying and selling of ads across multiple ad networks. It is an ad server or management platform for app publishers that provide them with tools to manage their ad inventory. It does so by trafficking 3rd party ads through its line item or javascript tag integration.</p><p>Moreover, it allows publishers to prioritize these ad campaigns through line item types and their performance.</p><p><br></p><h2>Google Ad Manager Work - The Process</h2><ol><li>Google Ad Manager calls ad inventory an ad unit. It is the space in the app dedicated to showing ads. Google Ad Manager generates a tag (code) for each of these ad units.</li><li>Publishers need to insert this tag into the app. Due to this tag, Ad Manager receives an ad request when users access the app page.</li><li>It is possible for publishers to create line items that highlight transactions with advertisers or buyers.</li><li>Google Ad Manager algorithms work in a way that enables the most relevant ad to serve at the time the request is made.</li></ol><p>This is how Google Ad Manager works in its most basic form! However, publishers have the liberty to optimize their ad inventory further by using innovative tools offered by GAM. Moreover, different types of Google Ad Manager accounts can <a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/blog/how-to-maximize-ads-revenue-with-app-open-ads/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maximize their ad revenue</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Types Of Google Ad Manager Accounts</h2><p><br></p><h3>· The Free Type – Google Ad Manager</h3><p><br></p><p>This free version of Ad Manager is designed for small to medium-sized publishers. It offers features such as managing, reporting, and access to API.</p><p><br></p><h3>· The Premium Type – Google Ad Manager 360 / GAM 360</h3><p><br></p><p>The premium or paid version is called Google Ad Manager 360 or GAM 360. It offers access to features including advanced reporting, video solutions, interactive ad formats, and better segmentation among others.</p><p><br></p><p></p><h2>Difference Between Google Ad Manager, Google AdMob &amp; Google Ad Exchange</h2><p><br></p><p>The Google Ad Manager is a unified platform that enables you to manage direct sales, third-party networks, and automated demand for websites, mobile apps as well as games. While Google Ad Exchange and Google AdMob are platforms that help publishers sell ads.</p><p>Google AdMob can be accessed directly as an ad network. Publishers can <a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-app-monetization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monetize mobile apps</a> by serving ads globally. However, to access Google Ad Exchange publishers need to have a GAM account as it is a central place to monetize all types of inventory types.</p><p><br></p><h2>How To Access Google Ad Manager 360?</h2><p><br></p><p>Publishers cannot directly set up GAM 360! Publishers must receive an invitation from Google to access Google Ad Manager 360. However, publishers can check if they are eligible.</p><p>App publishers who have crossed the monthly impression thresholds and meet all the eligibility criteria can ask Google to review their accounts and request an invitation link.</p><p>You can use GAM 360 after receiving the invite link.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>To access GAM 360:</strong></p><ul><li>Log in to Google Ad Manager</li><li>Click on Admin Linked Accounts</li><li>Connect Your Properties</li><li>Submit your app URL</li><li>View your AD inventory</li></ul><p><br></p><p>In case you are not eligible, connect with a Google Channel Partner and avail of premium demand without the hustle-bustle.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about GAM 360? Or still, have doubts about GAM?</p><p>Speak to a GAM 360 expert right away!

      '<p>Ad revenue optimization platforms and ad mediation techniques have always aimed at increasing demand for ad inventory. Most ad revenue optimization platforms increase the competition between demand partners and advertisers so that you, as a publisher, can obtain the highest earning possible by generating maximum eCPM and fill rates.</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve this, you may be considering or have already signed up on AppLovin\'s MAX Platform, but have you yet integrated Google Ad Manager or Google ADX demand to reap maximum ad revenue?</p><p>Before we explore why and how to integrate GAM with the MAX platform, let us take a deeper look at MAX mediation.</p><p><br></p><h2>What is Max Mediation? And Why Is Max Considered A Better Way To Monetize Apps?</h2><p><br></p><p>AppLovin MAX is an ad mediation tool that offers complete control to app publishers over their ad inventory. Publishers can explore open bidding, in-app bidding, and waterfall stack or optimize their ad revenue through a hybrid approach. With MAX, app publishers are given the option to migrate their waterfall setup, use automation to optimize eCPM, and work efficiently with API management.</p><p>MAX can single-handedly manage numerous ad networks such as AdMob, InMobi, Meta Audience Network, Chartboost, etc. from a unified dashboard. It can also make multiple ad requests to the same ad network. App publishers do not need to spend time experimenting with various ad networks as MAX mediation can cohesively optimize and accelerate ROI.</p><p>But how can integrating Premium Ad Networks – such as <a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/blog/quick-guide-on-google-adx/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google ADX</a> generate more ad revenue, and why should app publishers consider integrating it?</p><p><br></p><h2>Why Integrate Google Ad Manager on AppLovin\'s MAX Platform?</h2><p><br></p><p>With MAX, app publishers can use Google Ad Manager (GAM) as a real-time bidder, without any additional SDK integration, if you are already using AdMob SDK. This allows MAX users to control and benefit from the high-quality demand from Google AdX using GAM.</p><p>GAM is a pure marketplace where advertisers can buy inventory without any intermediary adding value for the publisher’s inventory through trade desks, agencies, etc. as compared to ad networks like AdMob or Meta Audience Network.</p><p><br></p><h2>Here is why you should integrate GAM with MAX:</h2><p><br></p><ul><li>Get the highest bidding prices from GAM and increase ad inventory’s value with robust and automated bidding. This can be further leveraged by AI/ML bidding systems to optimize fill rates and overall boost ad revenue.</li><li>Integrating GAM with MAX also expands the scope of revenue optimization by allowing multiple ad request calls from the same ad network – in this case, GAM.</li><li>Ad Ops experts and app publishers also experienced an increase in ad revenue by 15% to 20% by using GAM with MAX.</li><li>Amplify competition and create new opportunities for auction as publishers have the liberty of creating different GAM accounts and generating tags individually.</li><li>Moreover, having the facility to access Google Ad Network as a bidder from MAX mediation can decrease overheads related to additional ad operations.</li><li>Google ADX or even Google AdMob can be managed better along with other demand platforms, and as a publisher, you can experience a substantial reduction in transaction latency.</li><li>Integrating Google ADX as a demand partner can offer you an advanced choice.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>How To Integrate Google Ad Manager on the MAX Platform?</h2><p><br></p><p>To integrate GAM with MAX, you can follow the developer\'s manual from AppLovin and contact an ad operation expert from AppBroda for optimization.</p><p><br></p><h2>Don\'t Have A Google ADX Account yet?</h2><p><br></p><p>Using MAX as an <a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/mobile-app-monetization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">app monetization platform</a> is undoubtedly advantageous, but with Google ADX you can exploit even bigger advertisers yielding higher eCPMs and fill rates.</p><p><a href="http://archive.appbroda.com/google-adx-partner" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Connect with a Google AdX Partner</a> or Google AdX Reseller such as AppBroda and leverage uncharted demand partners via Google AdX.</p><p>At AppBroda, we help you access Google Ad Exchange and optimize ad revenue through MAX or other <a href="https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/mobile-app-monetization-platforms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monetization platforms</a> like IronSource or Appodeal.

      '<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Google Admob currently represents about 65% of programmatic ad revenue and Google Ad Manager adds another nice layer of 17% on average for most publishers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Google’s move to Open Bidding, which is supposed to happen on Nov 1 2023, has not yet yielded the best results for publishers who have experimented with switching off admob and GAM in their non-bidding sections of mediation. These experiments have yielded negative 5 to negative 10 percent ARPDAU giving publishers jitters about Google’s “bidder” which clearly needs to level up to compensate for this dip in revenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There is, however, good news for publishers in the post bidding world for 3 reasons:</span></p><p><br></p><ol><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Google Ad Manager for the win!: </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">The biggest ad-mon hack in the last 2 years has been the emergence of GAM as the 3rd largest ad network for these games with its friendly payment terms and intense reseller competition ensuring that publishers found a nice new stream of cash. One of the biggest concerns is that GAM will not be a part of the 2024 growth story. Nothing is further from the truth. The upcoming change to bidding is a welcome one for GAM resellers who have in-depth knowledge of the product who are not acting as simple “resellers”. GAM will continue to be an important part of publishers’ ad stacks as long as you are working with a reseller who knows how to navigate this change. GAM offers a ton of optimizations that will ensure it remains an important non-bidding network and will perform alongside Google Admob bidding.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Increasing in SoW for other networks: </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">Other ad networks that have been &lt;5% of the share of wallet should see an increase in their performance as Google will not be able to win a lot of the bids given the new setup. Added to this, the entrance of new networks like Pangle, Mintegral, Amazon etc are a reason for publishers to experiment with a different waterfall to test out how to mitigate the impact of bidding.</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Investing in the IAP DNA: </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">For the past few years, Google had undoubtedly let the publisher side of the marketplace benefit from its current setup which had led to the boom in casual and hyper casual gaming thus allowing studios who cracked the code on ad arbitrage overtake studios who had games with higher retention rates but lower knowledge capital on these hacks. This meant that teams could earn higher LTV despite not focusing on deeper gameplays and richer IAP triggering moments. The buzz around “hybridcasual” is a great example of how product managers and monetization teams are now looking at new genres (or tweaking current core loops) to monetize via IAP and Rewarded Ads better.</span></li></ol><p><br><p><a href="https://appbroda.com/get-started/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://archive.appbroda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-CTA.png" alt="AppBroda - Google Publishing Partner" height="328" width="900"></a></p></p>',
