      '<p>Ad mediation offers app publishers a more profound control and allows them to make better decisions on where to sell their ad inventory. Ad mediation\'s primary role is to increase the yield and generate more revenue for the publisher\'s inventory, leading to a higher eCPM and lifetime value.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/worldwide#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20in%20the%20App,US%24204.90bn%20in%202022." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Statista</a>, the total revenue generation in the App market is projected to reach US$430.90bn by the end of 2022. With an annual growth rate of 9.27%, the market volume is projected to increase by US$614.40bn in 2026.</p><p>These figures justify that global digital advertising expenditure is constantly increasing every year. And publishers are trying to find ways to maximize their ad revenue opportunities – Ad mediation being one such tool!</p><p>So, let us explore everything about ad mediation!</p><p><br></p><h1>What Is Ad Mediation?</h1><p><br></p><p>Ad mediation helps with app monetization and revenue optimization. It allows app publishers to manage and optimize multiple ad networks from one place by simply integrating an SDK. With ad mediation, publishers can explore and offer their ad inventory to multiple advertisers, maximizing their eCPM and fill rates, ultimately <a href="https://www.appbroda.com/blog/how-to-increase-ad-revenue-through-user-experience-optimization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasing the overall ad revenue</a>.</p><p>In simple words, ad mediation combines all ad networks under one platform. This lets app publishers discover top-performing ad networks and get the best bid for their ad inventory.</p><p>It reduces manual effort and automatically optimizes the fill rate to get the maximum revenue from each ad impression served.</p><p>By integrating an ad mediation platform, several ad networks can access the publisher\'s app inventory. This leads to higher competition, offering competitive eCPMs and more ad revenue for app developers.</p><p><br></p><h1>How Does An Ad Mediation Platform Work?</h1><p><br></p><p>Ad mediation platforms follow the waterfall approach, also called waterfall mediation or waterfall bidding.</p><p>This means app publishers can rank multiple ad networks according to their preferences. The first ad request is sent to the top revenue-generating ad network, and if that ad network cannot fill the ad or match the desired eCPM, the ad request moves to the next ad network.</p><p>App publishers continue sending ad requests to all the ad networks on the list until the request is filled with the desired eCPM. When these ad networks are ranked based on their historical data and are analyzed regularly, it gives the maximum eCPM and fill rates to the publisher.</p><p><br></p><h1>What Are The Best Mobile Ad Mediation Platforms For Mobile Apps?</h1><p><br></p><p>Choosing the right ad network is key to revenue optimization. Hence, app publishers must analyze the ad networks within the ad mediation platform while opting for the best ad mediation platforms.</p><p>Publishers need to consider how the ad networks will improve their fill rate, get them higher eCPMs, and the type of ad formats and placements they can indulge in that can lead to maximum revenue optimization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here are the top three ad mediation platforms for mobile apps:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.appbroda.com/blog/best-ad-mediation-platforms-for-mobile-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AdMob by Google</a></li><li><a href="https://www.appbroda.com/blog/google-admob-vs-ironsource/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ironSource</a></li><li><a href="https://www.appbroda.com/blog/google-admob-vs-applovin-the-ultimate-comparison/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppLovin</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h1>How Do Publishers Optimize Revenue with Ad Mediation?</h1><p><br></p><p>Ad mediation has several advantages through which app publishers can eventually optimize ad revenue. Let us explore some of them and see how they lead to <a href="https://www.appbroda.com/ad-revenue-optimization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ad revenue optimization</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Automation</h2><p><br></p><p>Each ad network has its advantages and limitations and is differentiated based on budgets, geo, ad formats, and campaign goals. It can be highly challenging for publishers to manually compare all these ad networks and change their priorities in real-time.</p><p>However, publishers can automate this process with an automated waterfall approach. They can dynamically investigate every ad opportunity and optimize ad revenue in real time.</p><p><br></p><h2>Control</h2><p><br></p><p>Monetizing a mobile app requires control which is made possible with ad mediation. Publishers can control when, how, and whom to sell their ad inventory.</p><p>Ad mediation platforms let publishers sell their inventory to the desired ad network at their desired eCPM. Publishers can set preferences for the desired ad networks by selecting waterfall bidding.</p><p><br></p><h2>Synchronize</h2><p><br></p><p>To optimize ad revenue, experimenting with multiple ad networks is a must! Mobile app publishers need to explore various ad networks to generate maximum revenue.</p><p>However, manually managing these ad networks can be challenging! The ideal solution is to use ad mediation to synchronize the ad networks within a single centralized platform.</p><p><br></p><h2>Data-Backed</h2><p><br></p><p>Some ad mediation platforms allow publishers to add user data to the ad serving flow. This further helps understand ad opportunities from the publisher\'s inventory. Various forms of user data can be leveraged, such as their device type, operating system, geographical behavior, etc.</p><p>Publishers can sustainably increase yield by integrating <a href="https://www.appbroda.com/blog/best-mobile-app-monetization-strategies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">app monetization strategies</a> related to advanced user targeting, data profiling, audience segmentation, and activation – which is easier with an ad mediation platform.</p><p>Moreover, publishers are given insights and metrics along with a detailed report on which ad networks are performing well for them. This makes the app monetization process even more fruitful and operative for developers.</p><p><br></p><h2>So, Which Is The Right Mobile Ad Mediation Platforms For You As An App Publisher?</h2><p><br></p><p>Pick an ad mediation platform that can offer Open RTB programmatic exchange, work on flexible budgets, and support private exchanges, direct deals, trading desks, and other functionalities.

      '<p>According to Statistics, there are around 3 million Android apps in the Google Play store and over 2 million apps in Apple’s App Store, used by approximately 3 billion smartphone users worldwide. With such enormous numbers, getting an app discovered by the users becomes very challenging for the app publishers.</p><p>So, how do you get your app to rank high and make sure it matches the intent of searches? The solution is to adapt App Store Optimization strategies for the Google Play and iOS App Store.</p><p>Here is an article that guides you on App Store Optimization that can help your app rank better.</p><p><br></p><h1>What is App Store Optimization?</h1><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.appbroda.com/app-store-optimization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store Optimization</a> (ASO) refers to the process of improving a mobile app\'s visibility. It also boosts the user appeal in the app stores and increases app conversion rates to get more downloads.</p><p>Just like internet marketers use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to help rank their web pages on Google’s top search results, app developers use App Store Optimization (ASO) or ASO techniques to get their apps ranked at the top of app store search results.</p><p>Simply put, ASO is the SEO for apps.</p><p>The most popular and major app stores are App Store for iOS apps and Google Play Store for Android apps. Understanding how ASO works and the factors that influence app ranking can help you analyze and improve your app’s reach to potential users.</p><p><br></p><h1>So, how does app store optimization work?</h1><p><br></p><p>Boosting the app’s revenue and achieving app downloads are the most important KPIs for mobile app publishers.</p><p>You can get those downloads by running paid app campaigns or by optimizing your app for organic traffic by following ASO best practices.</p><p>There are various ASO goals, but the primary one is to increase organic search ranking. Other subsequent goals of ASO are as follows:</p><ul><li>Provides you with quality DAU/ MAU</li><li>Increased brand exposure</li><li>More frequent and increased volumes of app reviews</li><li>Positive app reviews and ratings</li><li>Audience engagement</li><li>Additional marketing channel diversification</li></ul><p>Before jumping into the details, let’s first quickly explore the benefits of ASO.</p><p><br></p><h1>What are the Benefits of App Store Optimization?</h1><p><br></p><p>Apps get discovered through search, the higher your app ranks the higher the chance for your app to be viewed and get downloaded. This is why App Store Optimization is important.</p><p>It is the largest discovery channel for apps.</p><p>Visibility and exposure are the two most important benefits of ASO. In addition to this, you also experience other benefits such as:</p><ul><li>Better discovery by high-quality and relevant users</li><li>Increased organic app downloads</li><li>Lower user acquisition costs</li><li>Continuous app growth</li><li>Increased app revenue</li><li>Increased app conversion rates</li><li>Global audience reach</li></ul><p><br></p><h1>How does app store optimization help publishers?</h1><p><br></p><p>App Store Optimization (ASO) helps app publishers promote their mobile apps better. A good <a href="https://topsoftwarecompanies.co/seo/the-ultimate-aso-strategy-to-increase-your-ad-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ASO strategy</a> helps publishers reduce costs on advertising.</p><p>ASO needs a one-time investment and app developers can keep the downloads coming in with the right app store optimization strategy in place.</p><p><br></p><h1>An In-Depth Guide to App Store Optimization</h1><p><br></p><p>To boost your app’s organic growth, you first need to understand how people search and find apps. App store users use search queries to find different apps. Similarly, app stores recommend additional apps based on user preferences and popularity.</p><p>The factors that largely impact app ranking include app title, keyword, description, app downloads, and rating. Let us understand how you can take advantage of these factors to improve your ASO strategy.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. Start With a Descriptive Title</h2><p><br></p><p>Your app title matters! It gives the users the first Impression. A good title not only helps identify what your app does but also improves your app ranking.</p><p>Apple iOS App Store and Google Play handle titles and keywords differently, so how you approach your title should depend on if you’re marketing to Apple or Android users.</p><p><strong>For Example</strong>, App Store gives 255 characters for the title while Google Play offers 30 characters, therefore you have to be extremely concise.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Use Keyword Smartly</h2><p><br></p><p>Choosing the right keywords and using them wisely is extremely important.</p><p>Researching the keywords you have selected will help learn about the traffic, difficulty, and demand and optimize those effectively.</p><p>Appstore offers only 100 characters for the keywords while there is no specific keyword field for Google Play. For best Optimization using the right keywords 3 or more times in the description helps.</p><p><br></p><p>However, there is a fine line between optimizing your app description and stuffing it with keywords. Overuse of keywords might get your app penalized. Therefore you need to be careful while implementing keywords.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>3. Provide a Detailed App Description</h2><p><br></p><p>Your app description is the selling factor for your app! You have brought your potential users this far, you want to be able to close the deal and make the sale. This is possible with a well-written app description.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For Example,</strong>&nbsp;Your app description must fulfill questions like What does your app do? What problem does it solve? How will it make the user\'s life easier? Why is it worth the price?</p><p>Having useful screenshots that can visually represent your app functionality and features will be an added advantage.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Use High-Quality Screenshots and Videos</h2><p><br></p><p>People are spending only seconds scrolling deciding if they’re going to download an app or not.</p><p>Having high-quality screenshots that can visually represent your app functionality and features will make a big difference.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to this, you can also have an app preview video. It will give the users a better perspective of what your app can offer.</p><p><br></p><h2>5. Encourage Positive Reviews and Ratings</h2><p><br></p><p>Positive ratings and reviews have a significant impact on your App Store Optimization efforts.</p><p>Of course, they need to be honest reviews from people who have actually downloaded the app. Getting social reviews from customers within the app and sending notifications to leave a review might help.</p><p>On the flip side, don’t ignore any comments - positive or negative. Make sure you reply to the customer reviews and answer their questions whenever possible.</p><p><br></p><h2>Conclusion:</h2><p><br></p><p>ASO is a process that needs to be constantly monitored and tweaked over a period of time. To reap its rewards, you need to invest time and effort.</p><p>Apart from having a solid App Store Optimization (ASO) strategy you also need to ensure that your app is user-friendly and offers something distinct.</p><p>If you feel you can use some help, get in touch with an AppBroda expert!
